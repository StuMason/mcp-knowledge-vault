      "content": "\n# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers\n\n## Overview\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) servers are services that expose data, tools, and prompts to Large Language Models (LLMs) through a standardized interface. They allow LLMs to interact with external systems, execute functions, and access information that would otherwise be unavailable to them. MCP servers bridge the gap between powerful AI models and specialized tools, data sources, or systems.\n\n## Core Capabilities\nMCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:\n\n1. **Tools**: Functions that can be invoked by LLMs to perform actions, calculations, API calls, and more\n2. **Resources**: Data sources that can be read by clients and LLMs, like files, database records, or API responses\n3. **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help LLMs perform specific tasks consistently\n\n## Protocol Architecture\n\nThe MCP architecture follows a client-server model:\n\n- **Hosts**: LLM applications like Claude Desktop that initiate connections\n- **Clients**: Components within the host that manage connections to MCP servers\n- **Servers**: Services that provide tools, resources, or prompts through the standardized protocol\n- **Transport Layer**: Handles communication between clients and servers (typically STDIO or HTTP with SSE)\n\n## Communication Mechanisms\n\nMCP servers support multiple transport mechanisms:\n\n1. **Standard Input/Output (STDIO)**:\n   - Used for local process-based integration\n   - Simple to set up and use\n   - Ideal for development and local environments\n   - Limited to same-machine communication\n\n2. **HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)**:\n   - Supports remote communication\n   - Enables server-to-client streaming\n   - Works across networks\n   - Requires more complex setup\n\nBoth transport mechanisms use JSON-RPC 2.0 as the message format.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Tool Execution\n- Tools are functions that LLMs can call through clients\n- Each tool has a name, description, and input schema\n- Clients can list available tools and invoke them with arguments\n- Tools can return text, images, audio, or embedded resources\n- Servers can notify clients when the list of tools changes\n\n### Resource Management\n- Resources represent data that can be accessed by clients and LLMs\n- Each resource has a unique URI, name, and optional metadata\n- Resources can contain text or binary data\n- Clients can list, read, and subscribe to resources\n- Supports URI templates for dynamic resource access\n\n### Prompt Templates\n- Prompts are reusable templates for LLM interactions\n- Each prompt has a name, description, and optional arguments\n- Clients can list available prompts and retrieve them with arguments\n- Prompts can include dynamic content and resource references\n- Supports multi-step conversations and workflows\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nMCP servers expose powerful capabilities that require careful security handling:\n\n1. **User Control**:\n   - Users should explicitly consent to tool usage\n   - Clients should present clear information about tool capabilities\n   - Client applications control what operations are allowed\n\n2. **Input Validation**:\n   - Validate all tool inputs\n   - Sanitize resource paths to prevent traversal attacks\n   - Implement proper access controls\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - Gracefully handle errors without exposing sensitive information\n   - Implement timeouts for long-running operations\n   - Rate limit tool executions\n\n## Available Implementations\n\nMCP servers can be implemented in various languages using the provided SDKs:\n\n- Python SDK\n- TypeScript SDK\n- Java SDK\n- Kotlin SDK\n- C# SDK\n\n## Compatible Clients\n\nMCP servers can connect to a growing list of client applications including Claude Desktop App, Claude Code, Cursor, and many others.\n\n## Example MCP Servers\n\nMany pre-built MCP servers are available for common use cases including file systems, database access, development tools, web automation, productivity tools, and AI-specialized tools.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe MCP specification is maintained at [spec.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) and defines the protocol requirements, message formats, and interaction patterns. The latest version is typically referenced with a date, such as 2025-03-26.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [MCP Official Website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n- [Example Servers Repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)\n- [MCP Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture)\n"
