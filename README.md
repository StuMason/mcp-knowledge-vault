# Knowledge Vault MCP

A powerful knowledge management system that allows AI models to store, retrieve, and manage information through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

Knowledge Vault MCP is a specialized MCP server that provides structured storage and retrieval of knowledge in a format that's easily accessible to both humans and AI models. It serves three key purposes:

1. **Personal Context**: Store personal information and preferences to provide AI models with user-specific context across different conversations
2. **Project Knowledge**: Maintain important project-specific information that might not be immediately apparent from the codebase alone
3. **Current Information**: Keep AI models up-to-date with information about new technologies, tools, and developments that have emerged after their training cutoff dates

The system organizes information into categories and topics, making it simple to maintain and access a growing knowledge base.

## Features

- **Organized Knowledge Structure**
  - Category-based organization
  - Topic-based content management
  - Markdown-formatted content support

- **Powerful Search Capabilities**
  - Full-text search across all topics
  - Category-specific searches
  - Semantic search support

- **Easy Content Management**
  - Add new topics
  - Update existing content
  - Organize content into categories
  - List all available topics

## Usage

The Knowledge Vault supports several operations through its MCP interface:

### Searching Content

Search across all topics in the knowledge vault with support for filtering and categorization.

### Looking Up Topics

Retrieve detailed information about specific topics by name.

### Listing Contents

View all available topics, optionally filtered by category.

### Updating Content

Add new topics or update existing ones with markdown-formatted content.

## Integration

This Knowledge Vault is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing seamless integration with AI models and applications that support the MCP standard. For more information about MCP, see the [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/).
